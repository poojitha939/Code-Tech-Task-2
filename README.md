## Objective
The objective of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is to analyze and summarize datasets to uncover insights, identify patterns, and prepare for furtherÂ analysis.

### Key Activities
- **Understanding the Structure**: Investigate the structure of the data (e.g., the number of rows and columns, data types).
- **Visualizing Data**: Use visualizations like histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identify the relationships between variables, including linear or non-linear correlations.

  ### Technologies Used
  - **python**: The primary programming language for data analysis.
  - **pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
  - **matplotlib**: Empolyed for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
  - **seaborn**: used for creating attractive and informative statistical data visualizations, making it easier to explore and understand data.
